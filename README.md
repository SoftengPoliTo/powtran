POWer TRace ANalyzer

Is an **R** package that is able to analyze power traces from repeated executions of software 
applications or algorithms in a efficient and accurate way.

The power traces are expected to be collected according to the following protocol:

- each work unit must be preceded a and followed by a marker

- the markers consist in a square pulse that has to be generated by a fragment of code keeping the processor as busy as possible. The pulse is preceded by (equally long) sleep period.

E.g.
```
      __B__                  __B__
      |   |     __work__     |   |
      |   |     |      |     |   |
.__S__|   |__S__|      |__S__|   |__S__...
```

- the work units are repeated several times (default: 30) in order to obtain an accurate estimate of the real power consumptiom.

The effective power consumption is estimated by subtracting the sleep level power from the average power measured during the work phase.
